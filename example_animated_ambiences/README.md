I don't own the original, public images. I've only cropped, resampled and optimized versions for SFOS animated wallpapers. Tested only on XA2 Ultra.

To install these copy each folder to /usr/share/ambience/ and restart lipstick. You may need to remove one or more of the existing ambiences (the canned ones) to make them show up.
