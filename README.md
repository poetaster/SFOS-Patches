# SFOS-Patches
Patches I'm making available to others for SFOS.

Use at your own peril. Results may vary. Some exceptions apply. Not redeemable in Nevada. No cash value.

Most of these patches are developed on or around SFOS 4.0 or 4.1. Most of these are easily rebased to more recent versions of SFOS. If you want to package to redistribute on OpenRepos, please include this github Repo as the source.
